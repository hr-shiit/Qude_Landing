# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Petra wallet integration to the Next.js application, enabling users to connect their Aptos wallets for authentication and transaction capabilities. The integration will provide a seamless Web3 experience with proper error handling, connection state management, and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Petra wallet to the application, so that I can authenticate and interact with Aptos blockchain features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to connect their Petra wallet
2. WHEN Petra wallet is not installed THEN the system SHALL display a message directing users to install the Petra wallet extension
3. WHEN the wallet connection is successful THEN the system SHALL display the connected wallet address
4. WHEN the wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF the user has previously connected their wallet THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect on page load

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my wallet connection status clearly, so that I know whether I'm connected or need to connect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display the wallet address in a truncated format (e.g., 0x1234...5678)
2. WHEN the wallet is not connected THEN the system SHALL display a "Connect Wallet" button
3. WHEN the wallet is connecting THEN the system SHALL display a loading state
4. WHEN hovering over the connected address THEN the system SHALL show the full wallet address in a tooltip

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect my wallet when needed, so that I can manage my wallet connections securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL provide a "Disconnect" option
2. WHEN a user clicks disconnect THEN the system SHALL clear the wallet connection state
3. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL return to the initial "Connect Wallet" state
4. WHEN disconnecting THEN the system SHALL clear any cached wallet data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wallet integration to handle network changes gracefully, so that my connection remains stable across different Aptos networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches networks in Petra wallet THEN the system SHALL detect the network change
2. WHEN on an unsupported network THEN the system SHALL display a warning message
3. WHEN returning to a supported network THEN the system SHALL restore normal functionality
4. IF the network change causes connection issues THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to reconnect

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the wallet integration to be reusable across the application, so that other components can easily access wallet functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing wallet features THEN the system SHALL provide a React context for wallet state management
2. WHEN components need wallet data THEN the system SHALL provide custom hooks for easy access
3. WHEN wallet state changes THEN the system SHALL notify all subscribed components
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize wallet connection state properly
